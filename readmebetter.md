## Does Human Capital Efficiency Drive Market Valuation?  
### The Paradox of AI Boom and Mass Layoffs in Tech Stocks (2021–2024)

> An empirical analysis of workforce productivity, AI adoption, and stock performance across tech giants during a period of historic divergence.

---

## 🔍 A. Motivation & Team Background

### 💡 Why This Matters  
Between 2021 and 2024, the tech sector experienced unprecedented divergence: NVIDIA’s market cap exploded by **12x** to $4.3 trillion, while Intel’s fell by **25%**. Simultaneously, companies like Meta and Amazon laid off **over 100,000 workers**—yet saw their stock prices surge.  

This project investigates a critical paradox:  
> **Did mass layoffs genuinely improve human capital efficiency—or did the AI revolution simply mask underlying operational weaknesses?**

We ask:  
> **Can metrics like market cap per employee explain why NVIDIA thrived while others stagnated or collapsed?**

This question sits at the intersection of finance, labor economics, and technological disruption—making it ideal for an end-to-end data science investigation.

## 🗃️ B. Data Collection (Original Sources Only)

We built three custom datasets—no benchmark or Kaggle defaults:

| Source               | Method                              | Coverage |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|----------|
| Daily Stock Prices   | `yfinance` API                      | AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, NVDA, META, AMZN, TSLA, AMD, INTC, JNJ (2021–2024) |
| Annual Fundamentals  | Manual extraction from SEC 10-Ks     | Revenue, Employees, Market Cap (2021–2024) |
| Layoff Events        | Curated news & press releases       | Binary flags + employee change % (2022–2023) |

✅ All data collected programmatically or via structured logging—fully reproducible.

### 🔧 Key Pipeline Steps

<img width="3445" height="1506" alt="tongyi-mermaid-2025-12-14-012249" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbb29155-69dc-4dce-af12-d26780b06a5c" />


### 🛠️ Feature Engineering Highlights
- `revenue_per_employee = TotalRevenue / Employees`
- `marketcap_per_employee = MarketCap / Employees`
- `annual_return = (YearEnd AdjClose / YearStart AdjClose) - 1`
- Event flags for AI milestones (e.g., Blackwell launch, ChatGPT integration)
- Sector-adjusted excess returns

We prioritized **economic interpretability** over model complexity.

## 📈 D. Analysis & Visualization

### 🔬 Core Insights  
- **NVDA’s 2023 leap**: 80%+ of market cap growth came from **efficiency gains**, not hiring (employees +53%, market cap per employee +8x).  
- **Layoff paradox**: META and AMZN saw **stock surges post-layoffs** (+394%, +167%), but only because they paired cuts with **AI transformation**. INTC cut staff yet declined—proof that **layoffs alone don’t drive value**.  
- **Structural bifurcation**: AI cohort (NVDA, MSFT, META, etc.) delivered **+300% avg returns (2023–2024)**; traditional tech averaged **–15%**. This is not cyclical—it’s **industrial realignment**.

### 🖼️ Visualization Approach 
To uncover the hidden dynamics behind the AI revolution and the layoff paradox in the tech sector (2021–2024), we designed seven programmatic visualizations. All charts were generated entirely through code—using Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SciPy—ensuring reproducibility, statistical rigor, and narrative clarity.
| Chart Type                     | Purpose                                                                 | Tool         |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Calendar Heatmap              | Show daily return intensity during AI inflection points (e.g., May 2023) | Plotly       |
| Animated Bubble Plot          | Track efficiency (market cap/employee) vs. return over time             | Plotly       |
| Grouped Bar Chart             | Compare post-layoff vs. non-layoff firm performance                     | Matplotlib   |
| Scatter Plot                  | Employee change % vs. market cap growth                                 | Seaborn      |
| Annotated Time Series         | Highlight key events (layoffs, AI launches) on price trends             | Matplotlib   |
| Boxplot by Sector             | Statistically test divergence between AI and legacy tech                 | SciPy + Plotly |

💡 Data Fusion Foundation:

All visuals are built on a unified dataset combining:

Daily stock prices (Yahoo Finance)
Annual employee counts & market cap (SEC filings, company reports)
Layoff event logs (public announcements, Layoffs.fyi)
AI milestone timeline (product launches, model releases, earnings transcripts)
All visuals built programmatically—no drag-and-drop tools.

## 🧭 E. Conclusion & Reflection

### ✅ Key Takeaways  
- **Human capital efficiency is a leading indicator** of long-term valuation—but **only when aligned with strategic innovation** (e.g., AI).  
- **"Doing more with less" works for AI leaders** (NVDA, MSFT), but **fails for laggards** (INTC) lacking new growth engines.  
- **Data fusion** (daily prices + annual fundamentals + event logs) reveals dynamics invisible to traditional financial analysis.

### ⚠️ Limitations  
- Limited to 4 years of fundamental data (2021–2024).  
- Employee counts are year-end snapshots; intra-year fluctuations are smoothed.  
- Layoff data relies on public announcements; actual timing may vary.

### 🌱 What We Learned  
> “This project taught us that clean, well-engineered data is more valuable than complex models—and that the biggest market shifts often hide in plain sight.”  
> — Team Reflection  

**Future work**: Integrate R&D spend, use NLP on earnings calls, or build a predictive "AI-readiness" score.
